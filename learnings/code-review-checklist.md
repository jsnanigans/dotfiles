# Code Review Checklist

Based on our snacks.nvim experience, here's a checklist for reviewing code (your own or others').

## Before Writing Code

- [ ] **Have I read the existing code thoroughly?**
  - Understand current patterns
  - Find similar features
  - Check conventions

- [ ] **Is there a simpler solution?**
  - Start with the simplest thing that could work
  - Add complexity only when proven necessary

- [ ] **Am I solving a real problem?**
  - Not a hypothetical "what if someone wants to..."
  - Have actual use cases

## Architecture & Design

- [ ] **Does it follow existing patterns?**
  - Function signatures match similar functions
  - Configuration structure matches existing config
  - Same level of abstraction

- [ ] **Is there only ONE way to do things?**
  - No multiple configuration methods for same outcome
  - No redundant APIs
  - Clear, single path through the code

- [ ] **Does it compose with existing features?**
  - Works together with related features
  - No duplicate functionality
  - Predictable interactions

## Implementation

- [ ] **Is the configuration flat and simple?**
  ```lua
  -- Good
  { enabled = true, patterns = {...}, format = "..." }

  -- Bad
  { extract = fn, style = fn, transform = fn, cache = {...} }
  ```

- [ ] **Is error handling appropriate?**
  - Handle likely errors (bad input)
  - Don't over-engineer for impossible cases
  - Use pcall for user-provided patterns/regex

- [ ] **Am I building a framework?**
  - Red flag: Multiple abstraction layers
  - Red flag: Lots of configuration options
  - Red flag: "Extensible" or "flexible" in description

## Code Quality

- [ ] **Can I remove code?**
  - Remove features until it breaks
  - Add back only what's essential
  - Every line should justify its existence

- [ ] **Is it obvious?**
  - New developer can understand in 5 minutes
  - Doesn't feel "clever"
  - Seems like the inevitable solution

- [ ] **Would I want to maintain this?**
  - In 2 years, will I understand it?
  - Can I explain it simply?
  - Is debugging straightforward?

## Performance

- [ ] **Is complexity justified by performance needs?**
  - Don't add caching "just in case"
  - Profile before optimizing
  - Simple often performs better

- [ ] **Am I creating unnecessary allocations?**
  - Reuse tables where sensible
  - But don't sacrifice clarity for micro-optimizations

## Integration

- [ ] **Where does this belong?**
  - Part of existing module vs. new module
  - Consider where users would expect to find it
  - Group related functionality

- [ ] **How does configuration work?**
  - Consistent with existing config sections
  - Documented inline
  - Sensible defaults

## Final Questions

- [ ] **Can this be simpler?** (Ask 3 times)
- [ ] **Am I proud of how simple this is?** (Not how clever)
- [ ] **Would the maintainer merge this immediately?**

## Red Flags to Watch For

üö© "This might be useful later"
üö© "What if someone wants to..."
üö© Multiple ways to configure the same thing
üö© Deep nesting in config or code
üö© Lots of options that interact in complex ways
üö© Need for extensive documentation to explain it
üö© Feels clever or innovative
üö© "Framework" or "System" in your description
üö© Cache without proven performance need
üö© Abstract base classes or heavy inheritance

## Green Flags

‚úÖ Looks obvious in retrospect
‚úÖ Follows existing patterns exactly
‚úÖ Minimal configuration
‚úÖ Single responsibility
‚úÖ Can explain in one sentence
‚úÖ Deleting code made it better
‚úÖ Boring but effective
‚úÖ Small diff
‚úÖ Works with existing features naturally
‚úÖ Would be easy to debug

## The Ultimate Test

Show your code to someone unfamiliar with the codebase. If they can understand:
1. What it does
2. How to use it
3. Why it's implemented that way

...within 5 minutes, you've probably got it right.

## Remember

> "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry

The goal is not to handle every case, but to handle real cases elegantly and let users handle their special cases themselves.
