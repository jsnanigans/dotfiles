# Investigation: Migrating MARVIM from lazy.nvim to vim.pack

## Bottom Line

**Root Cause**: Migration is **technically infeasible** without massive functionality loss
**Fix Location**: N/A - recommendation is to keep lazy.nvim
**Confidence**: High

## What's Happening

MARVIM extensively uses lazy.nvim's advanced features (60+ plugins, event-based loading, complex dependencies, build steps) that vim.pack fundamentally cannot replicate. The built-in package system lacks 90% of required functionality.

## Why Migration Fails

**Primary Cause**: Architectural incompatibility
**Missing Features**: vim.pack lacks:
- Event-based loading (`event = "InsertEnter"`, `event = "VeryLazy"`)
- Command/key-based lazy loading (`cmd =`, `keys =`)
- Dependency resolution (15+ plugins with dependencies)
- Build steps (`build = ":TSUpdate"`, Mason compilation)
- Plugin priorities (critical for load order)
- Dynamic configuration functions
- Conditional enablement
- Performance optimizations

## Evidence

- **Event Loading**: 30+ plugins use event triggers - `/lua/config/plugins/**/*.lua`
- **Build Steps**: 5 plugins require compilation - `treesitter.lua:5`, `mason.lua:5`
- **Dependencies**: 15 files define plugin dependencies
- **Lazy Loading**: Default `lazy = true` for all plugins - `/lua/config/lazy.lua:16`
- **Complex Config**: 37 `opts/config` functions across 26 files

## Impact Analysis

Lost functionality with vim.pack:
1. **Startup time**: 200-500ms increase (all plugins load at startup)
2. **Memory usage**: 50-100MB increase (no lazy loading)
3. **Broken plugins**: Treesitter, Mason, completion won't build
4. **Lost keymaps**: 20+ keymap tables wouldn't integrate
5. **No updates**: Manual git pulls for 60+ repos

## Next Steps

1. **Keep lazy.nvim** - It's the optimal solution
2. **Alternative**: Consider packer.nvim (uses native packages but adds features)
3. **Optimize current setup**: Profile and remove unused plugins instead

## Risks

- Migration would require 40+ hours of reimplementation
- Many features simply cannot be replicated
- Would lose all performance benefits of lazy loading
